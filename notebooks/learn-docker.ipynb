The use of Linux containers to deploy applications is called containerization. Containers are not new, but their use for easily deploying applications is.\n\nContainerization is increasingly popular because containers are:\n* Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.\n* Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.\n* Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.\n* Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.\n* Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.\n* Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.\n\n\n## Images and containers\n\nA container is launched by running an image. An image is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application--the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.\n\nA container is a runtime instance of an image--what the image becomes in memory when executed (that is, an image with state, or a user process). You can see a list of your running containers with the command, docker ps, just as you would in Linux.\n\n\n## Containers and virtual machines\n\nA container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers. It runs a discrete process, taking no more memory than any other executable, making it lightweight.\n\nBy contrast, a virtual machine (VM) runs a full-blown “guest” operating system with virtual access to host resources through a hypervisor. In general, VMs provide an environment with more resources than most applications need.\n\n\n## Prepare your Docker environment\n\nInstall a maintained version of Docker Community Edition (CE) or Enterprise Edition (EE) on a supported platform.\n\n### Test Docker version\n\nRun 'docker --version' and ensure that you have a supported version of Docker:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"docker --version","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"NameError","evalue":"name 'docker' is not defined","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-1-80519671a67d>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 1\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mdocker\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m-\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m-\u001b[0m\u001b[0mversion\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'docker' is not defined"]}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Run 'docker info' or 'docker version' (without --) to view even more details about your docker installation:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"docker info","execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"SyntaxError","evalue":"invalid syntax (<ipython-input-2-38535935007d>, line 1)","traceback":["\u001b[0;36m  File \u001b[0;32m\"<ipython-input-2-38535935007d>\"\u001b[0;36m, line \u001b[0;32m1\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31m    docker info\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m              ^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31mSyntaxError\u001b[0m\u001b[0;31m:\u001b[0m invalid syntax\n"]}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To avoid permission errors (and the use of sudo), add your user to the docker group.\n\n\n### Test Docker installation\n\nTest that your installation works by running the simple Docker image, hello-world:\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"docker run hello-world","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"List the hello-world image that was downloaded to your machine:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"docker image ls","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"List the hello-world container (spawned by the image) which exits after displaying its message.
